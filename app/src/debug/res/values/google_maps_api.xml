    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    8C:D6:FC:C3:2B:6B:C8:5F:4D:A4:44:7A:4D:D7:56:4E:A8:5C:4E:BF

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
